Below are two of the freewrites that I wrote in my Freshmen Writing course at RIT. These were written in one draft, so they are far from perfect. But I feel they show some interesting thoughts that come out of my head.

11/15 “What motivates you?”
Questions. Curiosity. The need to move forward and discover. The desire to improve and leave the world better than I found it. That is what gets me up in the morning. Why? Possibly it’s my own selfish desire to be remembered as being a good person. Perhaps it’s some God Complex where I feel like I need to solve the world’s problems. Or maybe I’m just bored with how things are and I want to change things. I really don’t know why I’m curious. I don’t know why I ask questions. All I know is that I am me and I am a curious person. Why? I don’t think that really matters as long as I’m doing good.
I’m not sure where all this comes from. I’m not sure why I feel this way and do what I do. I don’t know why I’m here. I just know that I make things that matter.

12/4/15 “This I know to be true.”
This I know to be true. I make things. I make things with meaning. Or at least I try. Trying is the important part. But failing is hard. Sometimes I don't try because I'm afraid to fail. Those are the times I regret the most. I regret what I never try. Not everything I make has meaning. I think it was simplistic to say that earlier. I try to make things with meaning. But overall, I make things for fun and meaning can arise. It may not. I may make something utterly useless or pointless. Heck, I may not make something that works at all. I may stop before its done. But I'm still making things. That is what’s important in my life. Not to make things with meaning. Not to make things that work. Not to succeed at every project I do. Simply to make. If I keep making things, and trying new things and exploring, the rest will come. That is what I know to be true.
