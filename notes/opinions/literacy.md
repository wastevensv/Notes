# Literacy, Perspective, and Superpowers
The idea behind my HundredStories project and a post-mortem of why I closed it.
## The Idea
Literacy revolves around perspectives. Writing is recording our own perspective. Reading is the process of learning about another perspective. That perspective can be from this world (like in non-fiction or biographies) or from a fictional world (like in sci-fi or fantasy).

I've always had a fascination with other perspectives. There is a common question I ask other people. "If you could have a superpower (which is defined as the ability to do something outside the plausible laws of physics) what would it be?". Many people would say mind control, telekinesis, or shape-shifting. This can tell you a lot about a person. For me, my answer to this Superhero question would be to see the world through someone else's perspective and think like someone else for a day.

I'm now realizing that this superpower may be more plausible than I originally thought. To experience another perspective, you just need to find a writer who is honest enough to write about themselves. I started making HundredStories to learn about new perspectives. My plan was to record 100 stories from honest, open, and creative authors that are willing to share a chapter of their lives. That way, we could all have this superpower.

## How it Failed
I still stand by these ideas. However, the reality of creating a platform based on the promise of zero censorship is much easier said than done. It opens the doors to trolls and harrassment far more than it attracts actual writers. I realized this before hitting 20 stories. Instead of spending all my time playing editor, I decided to shut down the platform.

If you used HundredStories or are reading this and want to use it, I heavily encourage you to start a website like this one. Use it as place where you can publish your own opinions. I'm spending $35 annually to keep two domains running with privacy protection. I hope that there are other people out there who find their ideas are worth $0.10 a day and have the courage to share those ideas with the world.
