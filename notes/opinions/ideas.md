# The Evolution of Ideas

Ideas are alive. They aren't just static words on a paper. They can change, mature, and evolve over time. Sometimes ideas can survive well beyond our own mortal lifetimes. Sometimes ideas die far back in someone's mind, never to reach the spotlight of conversation. Every idea deserves to see a conversation, for that is the only way to truly understand its value.</p>

Conversations are the breeding ground of ideas. With each back and forth in a conversation, the participants move ideas forward by combining multiple ideas into a new, different idea. If a particular idea doesn't make sense, it is discarded. Only the ideas that are beneficial and further the conversation at hand survive in the long term. Much like the human evolutionary term "survival of the fittest" only the ideas that benefit us will survive the test of time.

If conversations are the breeding ground, then writings are the family scrapbook. Writings hold the records of where ideas came from, how they developed over time, and the current state of how people think about them today. However a typical scrapbook only contains a picture of the physical, objective moments in history. Our collection of writings is more than stating the current state of an idea. Writings also develop ideas by contributing the author's subjective viewpoint, adding their own spin to an idea.

In addition, writings create responses. A single writing will recieve a collection of letters agreeing or arguing with the point stated. Writing is simply a form of conversation that has a written record. In fact, most of what we consider to be culture is actually just another way of having a converstation.

One generation of creators inspires the next. Just like primates have evolved to humans, Mozart has evolved into Coldplay, Greek Satires have evolved into Monty Python skits. Ideas change. Ideas improve. Ideas evolve.
