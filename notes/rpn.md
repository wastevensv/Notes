# [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) Calculator
My Computer Science class has been covering the basic data structures. While I have a lot of experience coding, this is my first formal introduction to the theory behind programming. The knowledge I've been gaining has already proved useful. However, I don't always agree with the custom library they expect us to use. It feels like training wheels that will result in more relearning later. So alongside the assignments I've been getting in class, I make other programs without the training wheels library.

My most recent work has been a reverse polish notation calculator. I was introduced to reverse polish notation by my Intro to Computer Engineering mentor. The idea interested me, so I decided to write an implementation. However, I didn't want to use Python's built in lists. That would be to easy. I decided to apply the concepts I've been learning in CS I to write my own stack implementation using linked lists. To take it even further, I wrote the entire program without importing any external modules.

This program is still a rough draft. It was mostly written within one hour. I plan to extend the language so that I can clear the stack, print the stack unmodified, and add some more operations.

The source code for this program can be found in my [scrap-code](https://github.com/wastevensv/scrap-code/tree/master/python) repository.
